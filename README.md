# Data Visualization-and Communication

The study aims to delve into the bicycle usage data from the Washington Capital 
Bikeshare system. Specifically, it will analyze data spanning from January to April 
over the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Notably, this period includes the 
extension of the stay-at-home order by Governor Inslee on April 2, which lasted 
through at least May 4. This context provides a unique opportunity to assess how the 
pandemic and associated restrictions impacted bikeshare usage patterns.


The dataset file we used for the project is located [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZveV_4ELlc8TgksGIprv45lT2trTb8YE/view?usp=sharing) in zip format.
